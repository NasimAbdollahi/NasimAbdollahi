### Hi there 👋

My name is Nasim,

👩🏻‍💻 I’m currently a Staff Scientist – ML and AI Specialist at the Acceleration Consortium, University of Toronto, where we develop self-driving laboratories to accelerate molecule and material discovery.

🧬 I specialize in deep learning, active learning, graph neural networks, and generative models, with a focus on multimodal and multi-omics data integration across biomedical imaging, structural biology, and drug discovery. At the Acceleration Consortium, my main focus is on drug design and formulation development.
